## Introduction

In this project, I will be wrangling and analyzing a dataset which includes the total number of employees in Saudi
Arabia (Saudi (male) - Saudi (female) - non Saudi (male) - non Saudi (Female)) according to the size of the
enterprises (micros, small, medium, and large) and economic activity(using the National Classification of Economic
Activities (ISIC4) - the second level) in each geographical region for 2022.
